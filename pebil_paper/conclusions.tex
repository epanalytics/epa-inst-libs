\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:Conclusions}

In this paper we have introduced an efficient static instrumentation toolkit,
PEBIL, for Linux on the x86/x86\_64 platform family. PEBIL uses function
relocation in order to create enough space to enable instrumentation at
arbitrary points in an executable. PEBIL's function relocation mechanism and the
ability to insert efficient assembly code snippets are what allow PEBIL to
produce efficient instrumented executables. The overhead of PEBIL for counting
basic block executions on a set of applications is 1.6x less than the overhead of Dyninst, 
1.6x less than the overhead
of Pin, 4.7x less than the overhead of DynamoRIO, and 7.8x less than the overhead of
Valgrind. PEBIL is freely available
to the public for download at \url{http://blankforblindreview.com/}.
