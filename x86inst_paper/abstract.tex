Binary instrumentation facilitates the insertion of additional code into an
executable in order to observe or modify the behavior of application runs. 
There are two main approaches to binary instrumentation: static and dynamic
binary instrumentation. In this paper we present PEBIL, an efficient static 
instrumentation toolkit for Linux on x86/x86\_64 platforms. PEBIL
is similar to  other toolkits in terms of how additional code is inserted. However, it uses function-level
code relocation in order to remedy the difficulty created by the underlying variable-length instruction set. 
Code relocation of this kind allows the reorganization of the application code in such a way that it
can use fast far-reaching constructs to transfer control
from the application to the instrumentation code. Furthermore, the PEBIL API provides 
tool developers means to insert lightweight hand-coded assembly
rather than relying solely on the insertion of instrumentation functions.
Because of these features PEBIL enables implementation of efficient instrumentation tools. 
The overhead introduced by a simple basic block counting tool created using PEBIL is an
average of 1.6x less than the overhead introduced by Pin, 4.7x less than the overhead of
DynamoRIO, 7.8x less than the overhead of Valgrind, and 23x less than the overhead of Dyninst.
