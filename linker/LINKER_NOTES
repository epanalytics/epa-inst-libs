Some notes about special linker flags that can (and sometimes must)
be used.

1. -Wl,--hash-style=sysv 

This forces the linker to use sysv-style hash tables instead of 
gnu-style hash tables. This may result in very slight performance
degradation when resolving shared lib functions, but the result
should not be noticeable.

2. -T x86inst_link_script

If there isn't enough space prior to the beginning of the text
section to hold the extra text for instrumentation, it is possible to 
increase the space prior to the text segment by modifying the line
that looks similar to these in the linker script
PROVIDE (__executable_start = 0x08048000); . = 0x08048000 + SIZEOF_HEADERS;
PROVIDE (__executable_start = 0x400000); . = 0x400000 + SIZEOF_HEADERS;

The address given here will be the vaddr where the text segment will
reside. We can copy the contents of the system's linker script by
using the command `ld --verbose'. Then we can modify the above line
to give plenty of room prior to the beginning of the text segment.
